# Google Search Ad Blocker

Google Search Ad Blocker is a userscript that enhances your Google search experience by hiding sponsored content and advertisements from search results pages. This script is designed to work with userscript managers like Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey.

## Features

- Hides sponsored content at the top of search results
- Removes ads from the right-hand side panel
- Eliminates inline sponsored content within search results
- Automatically handles dynamically loaded content

## Installation

1. Install a userscript manager for your browser:
   - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (recommended)
   - [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) (Firefox only)
   - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)

2. Click on the following link to install the script:

   Alternatively, you can manually create a new script in your userscript manager and copy-paste the content of the `google-search-ad-blocker.js` file.

3. The script should now be active when you visit Google search results pages.

## Usage

Once installed, the script will automatically run on Google search results pages. You don't need to do anything else - just perform your searches as usual, and the sponsored content will be hidden.

## Customization

If you want to customize the script, you can edit it in your userscript manager. For example, you might want to:

- Modify the CSS to change how ads are hidden
- Add additional selectors to hide more types of sponsored content
- Adjust the script to work on other Google domains
